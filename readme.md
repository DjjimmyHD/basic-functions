## Learning to Learn

If you have been working on the same problem for more than 15 minutes, stop or ask for help. If you cant get help immedately,
take notes on your problem and come to class with questions. **TAKE BREAKS** You will burn out if you don't set up healthy habits to help you out when you're struggling. There are so many things you could be working on outside of trying to find that one syntax error. Make sure you start with a clear goal in mind and also retro your process.
